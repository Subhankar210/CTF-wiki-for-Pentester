Default passwords are intended to be place holders and used only for the initial setup of hardware or after a factory reset. The user enters the password and is usually prompted to change it as part of the process, but not always. Sometimes a systemengineer, developer or user forget to change a default password fot their hardware or software. As attacker we can use this information to get into their system. Defaults usernames and passwords are not uncommon.   

__Typical examples:__
admin:admin
guest:guest
demo:demo
user:password
user:Summer2020

Furthermore, a vendor generally uses a single default password, which can be easily found online through search or on websites that provide compiled lists.
