Manual
---------
[Manual privilege escalation](privilege-escalation-manual.md) is an extensive task where a lot of thinks should be checked before continuing during your pentest.

Automated scripts
---------
Manual privilege escalation could be a time consuming task and even you could forget something while checking all possible information.
So to make this process a bit easier [automated scripts](privilege-escalation-automated.md) are incredibly helpful.

__Warning: If you are working towards a certification such as OSCP. Be aware that automated scripts for enumeration are allowed, however automated exploitation is not allowed. LinPEAS, had a feature within it's script to automatically exploit. This is not allowed during an exam.
